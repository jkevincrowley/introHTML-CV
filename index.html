    <p>Constantly seeking a life filled with adventure, in all forms – personally, professionally, intellectually, and creating positive impact on the world around me along the way.
      <br>
      Hi, I’m Kevin (you can call me JKev), and I’m a thoughtful relationship-builder with a focus on sustainable business.
      <br>
      <br>
      I’ve been a <a href="https://landscapesontherun.com" target="_blank">travel blogger</a>, a photographer, destination marketer, outdoor recreation guide, Jesuit Volunteer, and even dabbled in commercial fishing & crabbing. Now I work in tech, helping businesses drive value from the use of location tech in wild ways, from improving supply chain efficiency to helping travelers experience the world in more engaging ways.
      <br>
      <br>
      These all may seem random, but are all tied together by a mission to seek adventure in all forms, accrue a diverse base of experiences early in my life, both personally and professionally, to help inform the future to come.
      <br>
      <br>
      Let’s talk about creating business for social and environmental good, building a life filled with meaning and balance, or about the latest outdoor adventure you embarked on, or are planning to.
      <br>
      <br>
      look forward to connecting – hello [at] jkev.in
